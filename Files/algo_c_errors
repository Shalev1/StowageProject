- trying to load container in last port
- loading duplicate containers on port
- reject first container in each port
- "forget" to load first reloaded container
- "forget" to unload containers in spot (0,0,0)
- if ship left with one empty spot, (1) skip all containers without giving them instructions and (2) load the container with the furthest destination
